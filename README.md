# wall4comment

Exchange anonymous constructive comments.

The name was originally inspired by the video game term **“4th Wall”** which can be somewhat interpreted as the divide between the fictional world of the video game and the real world, thus providing a sense of **anonymity** which could explain the questionable/violent actions that users sometimes perform in video games.

In order to keep this idea of **anonymity** while also not being so direct I came up with the name “Wall 4 Comment” which can be seen as either **“Wall For Comment”** as in a wall where people can stick comments, and no one will know who did it and/or a play on the term "4th wall".

That was creative, I know (trying to "break the 4th wall" with you, yes you the reader).
